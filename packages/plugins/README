# Plugins Package

This folder contains plugins for the UDSL (Universal Domain Specific Language) monorepo. Plugins extend the core functionality of UDSL by providing additional features, transformations, or integrations.

## Structure

This package is part of a larger monorepo structure and follows the established patterns for:

- TypeScript compilation
- Build outputs in `dist/` directories
- Turbo caching
- Standard Node.js package management

## Development

The plugins are built and cached using the monorepo's build system. Generated artifacts are automatically ignored via the root `.gitignore` configuration.

## Usage

Plugins can be imported and used to extend the core UDSL functionality. Each plugin should follow the established plugin architecture patterns defined in the core package.
